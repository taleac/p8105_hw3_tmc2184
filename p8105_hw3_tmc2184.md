> The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write

**The “instacart” dataset contains information on orders placed by
different instacart users, with 15 variables including details on the
order itself (e.g., time of order, order number) and the products
ordered (e.g., whether this is a reorder, product number, product
aisle). Variable names include order\_id, product\_id,
add\_to\_cart\_order, reordered, user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number,
order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day, days\_since\_prior\_order,
product\_name, aisle\_id, department\_id, and aisle. It contains 1384617
observations, comprising 131209 orders from 131209 users.**

> How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
> from?

**There are 134 aisles, and the most commonly ordered from aisle is
fresh vegetables.**

> Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
> limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
> aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle, name = "n_items") %>%
  subset(n_items > 10000) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, -n_items), y = n_items)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Instacart Items Ordered, by Aisle",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of Items"
  ) +
  theme(text = element_text(size=20),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1, size=10))
