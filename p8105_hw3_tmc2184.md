> The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write

**The “instacart” dataset contains information on orders placed by
different instacart users, with 15 variables including details on the
order itself (e.g., time of order, order number) and the products
ordered (e.g., whether this is a reorder, product number, product
aisle). Variable names include order\_id, product\_id,
add\_to\_cart\_order, reordered, user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number,
order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day, days\_since\_prior\_order,
product\_name, aisle\_id, department\_id, and aisle. It contains 1384617
observations (i.e., products from an order), comprising 131209 orders
from 131209 users.**

> How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
> from?

**There are 134 aisles, and the most commonly ordered from aisle is
fresh vegetables.**

> Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
> limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
> aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle, name = "n_items") %>%
  subset(n_items > 10000) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, -n_items), y = n_items)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Instacart Items Ordered, by Aisle",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of Items"
  ) +

# Problem 2

> Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to self-report
> techniques for studying physical activity in observational studies and
> clinical trials, largely because of their relative objectivity. During
> observation periods, the devices measure “activity counts” in a short
> period; one-minute intervals are common. Because accelerometers can be
> worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce around-the-clock
> observations. This problem uses five weeks of accelerometer data
> collected on a 63 year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the
> Advanced Cardiac Care Center of Columbia University Medical Center and
> diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF). The data can be
> downloaded here. In this spreadsheet, variables activity.\* are the
> activity counts for each minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.

> Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
> include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
> variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
> with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
> (e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

``` r
weekend_df=
  tibble(
    day = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"),
    weekend = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
  )
accel_data = read.csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(activity.1:activity.1440,
    names_to = "minute", 
    names_prefix = "activity.",
    values_to = "activity_count") %>%
  mutate(minute = as.integer(minute)) %>% 
  left_join(weekend_df, by="day")
```

**This dataset contains accelerometer data for a 63 year-old man
admitted Columbia University Irving Medical Center’s Cardiac Care unit
with congestive heart failure (CHF). Accelerometer data were collected
during each minute (24 hour day, beginning at midnight) over 35 days, 10
of which were weekend days, resulting in 50400 observations.**

> Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
> over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to
> create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
> showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

> Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of
> the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
> courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week.
> Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on
> this graph.
